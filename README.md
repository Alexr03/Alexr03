# Hi there, I'm Alexr03 👋

I'm a software developer who specializes in C# and .NET development. I love building high-performance, scalable applications. In addition to C#, I have experience with a variety of other technologies, including Java, web development frameworks like Blazor and ASP.NET, and backend frameworks like .NET Core.

## My Projects 🚧

Here are a few of the projects I've worked on recently:

- 🎮 **[TCAdmin v3](https://tcadmin.com/):** A game control panel for managing game servers, built with Blazor and .NET Core. It allows game server owners to easily manage their servers, view server logs, and perform updates.

- 🔥 **[STRP](https://forum.spaceturtl.es/):** A FiveM roleplay server built using LUA.

You can find more of my projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Alexr03).
