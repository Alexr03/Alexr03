# Hi there, I'm Alexr03 👋

I'm a software developer who specializes in C# and .NET development. I love building high-performance, scalable applications. In addition to C#, I have experience with a variety of other technologies, including Java, web development frameworks like Blazor and ASP.NET, and backend frameworks like .NET Core.

## My Projects 🚧

Here are a few of the projects I've worked on recently:

- 🔥 **STRP:** A FiveM roleplay server built using LUA. [STRP](https://forum.spaceturtl.es/)
